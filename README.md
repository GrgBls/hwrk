# hwrk

Simple python script I made one day while I was having an e-class. I didn't have any space on my notebook so I came up with an idea of a script that would automatically save my homework as .txt files on my laptop.


# Installation

> $ pip3 install hwrk

or just run the hwrk.py file.

# How does it work?

You just type `hwrk` on your terminal and the program starts. You then follow the on-screen guide. It's a really stupid script, but it was a good OOP practice for me.

# Example

> $ hwrk

> Enter (1) to add homework, (2) to view current homework: 1

> Enter subject's name: math

> Enter your homework: exercises 2,3,8 on page 97
