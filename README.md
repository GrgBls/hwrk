# hwrk

Simple python script I made one day while I was having an e-class. I didn't have any space on my notebook so I came up with an idea of a script that would automatically save my homework as .txt files on my laptop.


# Installation

> $ pip3 install hwrk


# How does it work?

You just type `hwrk` on your terminal and the program starts. You then follow the on-screen guide. It's a really stupid script, but it was a good OOP practice for me.

# Example

To add homework on a subject:
> $ hwrk add maths "exercise 1 on page 37"

To view assigned homework on a subject:
> $ hwrk view maths

To delete homework on a subject:
> $ hwrk remove maths
